  <p>Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) made dozens of breakthroughs in the production,
    transmission and application of electric power. He invented the first alternating current (AC) motor and developed
    AC generation and transmission technology. Though he was famous and respected, he was never able to translate his
    copious inventions into long-term financial success—unlike his early employer and chief rival, Thomas Edison.</p>

  <p>Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father was a
    priest in the Serbian Orthodox church and his mother managed the family’s farm. In 1863 Tesla’s brother Daniel was
    killed in a riding accident. The shock of the loss unsettled the 7-year-old Tesla, who reported seeing visions—the
    first signs of his lifelong mental illnesses.</p>
  <p>Tesla studied math and physics at the Technical University of Graz and philosophy at the University of Prague. In
    1882, while on a walk, he came up with the idea for a brushless AC motor, making the first sketches of its
    rotating
    electromagnets in the sand of the path. Later that year he moved to Paris and got a job repairing direct current
    (DC) power plants with the Continental Edison Company. Two years later he immigrated to the United States.
